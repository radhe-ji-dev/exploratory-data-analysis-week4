Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (ùöèùöíùöôùöú == ‚Äúùü∏ùü∫ùüªùü∑ùü∂‚Äù) from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

```{r}

        subset(fips == "24510") %>%
        group_by(year) %>%

Of the four types of sources indicated by the ùöùùö¢ùöôùöé (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999‚Äì2008 for Baltimore City?

Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999‚Äì2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

```{r}

    subset(fips == "24510") %>%
    group_by(year, type) %>%

Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999‚Äì2008?

To find the contributions to emissions from coal combustion, we should merge the NEI and SCC datasets to see the EI.Sector column, which will be filtered for words containing ‚Äúcoal‚Äù. The Short.Name column also contains this information; however, it includes contributions from coal that are not from combustion.
```{r}
SCC.coal.comb <- SCC[grep("[Cc]oal",SCC$EI.Sector),]
NEI.sub.coal <- subset(NEI, 
                       NEI$SCC %in% SCC.coal.comb$SCC)


NEI.coal.comb <- merge(x = NEI.sub.coal, 
                       y = SCC, 
                       by.x = "SCC", 
                       by.y = "SCC")

NEI.coal.comb.tot <- NEI.coal.comb %>% 
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarize(Total.Coal.Comb = sum(Emissions, na.rm = TRUE))

NEI.coal.comb.plot <- ggplot(NEI.coal.comb.tot, aes(year, Total.Coal.Comb))

NEI.coal.comb.plot <- NEI.coal.comb.plot + 
    geom_point(color = "red", 
               size = 4, 
               alpha = 1/3) + 
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Total Emissions [Tons]") +
    ggtitle("Total Annual Coal Combustion Emissions in the US")

NEI.coal.comb.plot
```


```{r}
NEI.coal.comb.tot.2008 <- NEI.coal.comb.tot[NEI.coal.comb.tot$year == 2008, 2]
NEI.coal.comb.tot.1999 <- NEI.coal.comb.tot[NEI.coal.comb.tot$year == 1999, 2]

NEI.coal.comb.delta <- NEI.coal.comb.tot.2008 - NEI.coal.comb.tot.1999

How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999‚Äì2008 in Baltimore City?

```{r}

               size = 4, 
               alpha = 1/3) + 
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Total Emissions [Tons]") +
    ggtitle("Total Annual Vehicle Emissions in Baltimore City")

Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (ùöèùöíùöôùöú == ‚Äúùü∂ùüºùü∂ùüπùüΩ‚Äù). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
